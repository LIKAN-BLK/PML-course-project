I've load data set from training file. Then I removed first column with number, because it useless for prediction. Then I remove column fulfilled by NA values, because make grate troubles for prediction. Then I removed columns with nero-zero &nbsp;variance. Then I divided data partition on test(40%) and training(60%) sets. Then I found all numeric columns for PCA preprocessing. Then I performed PCA &nbsp;.preprocessing data. Then I created model with random forests algorithm. And tested model on testing set,<br>Then I used model for prediction on data set from pml-testing.csv file &nbsp;
